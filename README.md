## üíª Technologies Used

This project utilizes modern web technologies for a robust and efficient solution:

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML**: For structuring web pages.
  - **CSS**: For responsive and visually appealing designs.

## üèõ Architecture Overview

This project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern:

- **Models**:
  - Represent the data and business logic of the system.
  - Examples include `Employee`, `Department`, `Project`, and `Leave`.

- **Views**:
  - Define the user interface and presentation logic.
  - Built using Razor syntax in `.cshtml` files for dynamic rendering.

- **Controllers**:
  - Handle user input, interact with models, and render appropriate views.
  - Example controllers include `EmployeeController`, `ProjectController`, and `AuthController`.

The project also implements a **Repository Pattern** for organizing data access logic, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

## üîê Authentication and Authorization

The HRMS Project incorporates robust **authentication** and **authorization** mechanisms to ensure secure access control and user management. These features are implemented using **ASP.NET Identity** with role-based access control.

### Authentication
- **Login Process**:
  - Users authenticate using their email and password via the `AuthController`. 
  - The `SignInManager` validates credentials and manages user sessions.
  - Invalid login attempts (e.g., wrong email or password) are handled with clear error messages.

- **Registration**:
  - New users are registered through the `EmployeeController`'s `SaveAdd` action method.
  - This method validates input data, checks for existing users with the same email or username, and assigns roles (e.g., `Employee`, `Manager`).

  Example Code:
  ```csharp
  public IActionResult SaveAdd(EmployeeDTO employeeDTO) {
      // Validate input and check for duplicates
      // Create new Employee instance
      // Assign role and save to database
  }
  ```

- **Password Management**:
  - Passwords are securely hashed using ASP.NET Identity's built-in functionality.

### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - The project uses roles such as **Admin**, **Manager**, and **Employee** to control access to specific features.
  - Role validation is performed using the `UserManager` and `SignInManager`.

- **Policy Enforcement**:
  - Controllers and actions are decorated with `[Authorize]` attributes to enforce access restrictions.
  - Example: Only employees and managers can access features like profile and leave management.

### Additional Features
- **Session Management**:
  - User sessions are managed securely, and users can log out at any time.

- **Redirect to Dashboards**:
  - Upon successful login, users are redirected to role-specific dashboards (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).
